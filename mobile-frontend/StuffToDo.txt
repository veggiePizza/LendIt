Right now it goes:

Welcome Screen (Go to Sign up) -> Welcome to SignUp Screen (Go to Sign In) -> Welcome to SignIn Screen (FIXED)

What I need to do:

Make a basic Welcome screen that lets user either: SignIn or SignUp (Priority) DONE

SignIn: Make a basic SignIn Screen that works with the firebase API to let them SignIn: Also add a back to welcome and go to signup screen navigation DONE

SignUp: Make a basic SignUp Screen that works with the firebase API to let them make an account: Also add a back to welcome and signin screen navigation DONE


==========NEXT===============

SignIn: The functionality is working to signin the user as shown by console logs but it should navigate to home screen

SignUp: The functionality is working to signup the user as shown by console logs but it should also navigate to home screen

Home Screen: Build out a base home screen
