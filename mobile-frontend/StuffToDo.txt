Welcome Screen (Go to Sign up) -> Welcome to SignUp Screen (Go to Sign In) -> Welcome to SignIn Screen (FIXED)

SignIn: Make a basic SignIn Screen that works with the firebase API to let them SignIn: Also add a back to welcome and go to signup screen navigation DONE

SignUp: Make a basic SignUp Screen that works with the firebase API to let them make an account: Also add a back to welcome and signin screen navigation DONE
